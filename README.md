# fantasy
Web front-end for a fantasy baseball application.

# BUGS:
* Insert under signup function fails
* String concatenation inside of SQL query in batters function
does not work, will have to finalize string before passing it along
for execution.
* Duplicates on leagues page
* References to "own" table in claims function should be changed to "owns"
* Attempting to click on a specific league name from the leagues view breaks the 
server because of a sql query error

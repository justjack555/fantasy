# fantasy
Web front-end for a fantasy baseball application.

# BUGS/TODO:
* Duplicates on leagues page (SOLVED)
* Attempting to click on a specific league name from the leagues view breaks the 
server because of a sql query error
* Change leagues.html to use user_leagues_names and all_leagues_names (add option to add any league under all leagues)
* Need claim option next to each player on pitchers page
* Need waive option next to each player on team page
* Need login page option on front page
* Need logout option on each page


# TODO after bug fixes:
* Check payroll checking for claims when login page is implemented
* Check proper league view when login page is implemented
* Check proper payroll update for waives when waive option is implemented
* General testing
* Weight bad stats negatively

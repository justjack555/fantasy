Web front-end for a fantasy baseball application.

# BUGS:
* Duplicates on leagues page
* References to "own" table in claims function should be changed to "owns"
* Attempting to click on a specific league name from the leagues view breaks the 
server because of a sql query error
* Need login page option on front page
* Need logout option on each page

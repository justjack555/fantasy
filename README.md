Web front-end for a fantasy baseball application.

# BUGS/TODO:
* League create testing

* Change leagues.html to use user_leagues_names and all_leagues_names (add option to add any league under all leagues)
* Need claim option next to each player on pitchers page
* Need waive option next to each player on team page


# TODO after bug fixes:
* Check proper payroll update for waives when waive option is implemented
* League add testing when leagues.html is fully implemented
* League transaction testing when waive option is implemented and waive data is in database
